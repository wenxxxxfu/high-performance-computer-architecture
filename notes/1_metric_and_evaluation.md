1. performance
	- latency
	- throughput
2. x is N times faster than y,means:
	- speedup = N
	- N = speed(x) / speed(y)
	- N = latency(y) / latency(x)
	- N = throughput(x) / throughput(y)
3. speedup
	- >1， improved performance：short execution time or higher throughput
	- <1，worse performance
	- performance ~ throughput or ~ 1/throughput
4. how to measure performance?
	- performance $\approx$  1 / execution time 
	- on what workload? its hard to use actual user workload because: many programs/cannot representative of other users/how do we get workload data
	- solution: benchmark
