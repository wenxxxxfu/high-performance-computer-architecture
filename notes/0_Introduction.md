1. Moore's Law: every 18-24 months, 2x transistors on same chip area
2. Which is equals to：
	- processor speed doubles every 18-24 months
	- energy operation 1/2 every 18-24 months
	- memory capacity 2x  every 18-24 months
	
3. memory wall:
	- instructions/second -> 2x every 2 years
	- memory capacity -> 2x very 2 years
	- memory latency -> 1.1x very 2 years

4. trade-off between speed、cost以及power
 5. power consumption：
	 - dynamic：consumed by activity in a circuit
	 - stastic: consumed when power on but idle
6. dynamic power: p =1/2 C V^2  f α
	- capacitance ~ chip area
	- V: power supply voltage
	- f：clock frequency
	- α：activity factor
	- smaller transistor allow us  to reduce supply voltage, and improve frequency, which result in lower power consumption
7. static power : when voltage reduce, leakage increment
8. a single chip's cost  is going to linearly proportional to its size
9. yield = working chips/chips on wafer
10. the benefit from   Moore's Law:
	1. smaller chips
	2. same area，but faster(high performance usually do)
