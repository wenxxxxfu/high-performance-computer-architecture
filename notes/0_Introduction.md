1. Moore's Law: every 18-24 months, 2x transistors on same chip area
2. Which is equals to：
	- processor speed doubles every 18-24 months
	- energy operation 1/2 every 18-24 months
	- memory capacity 2x  every 18-24 months
	
3. memory wall:
	- instructions/second -> 2x every 2 years
	- memory capacity -> 2x very 2 years
	- memory latency -> 1.1x very 2 years![[Pasted image 20241114153050.png]]

4. trade-off between speed、cost以及power![[Pasted image 20241114153314.png]]
 5. power consumption：
	 - dynamic：consumed by activity in a circuit
	 - stastic: consumed when power on but idle
6. dynamic power: p =1/2 C V^2  f α
	- capacitance ~ chip area
	- V: power supply voltage
	- f：clock frequency
	- α：activity factor![[Pasted image 20241114154746.png]]
	- smaller transistor allow us  to reduce supply voltage, and improve frequency, which result in lower power consumption
7. static power : when voltage reduce, leakage increment![[Pasted image 20241114155711.png]]
